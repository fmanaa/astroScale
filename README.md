# astroScale :ringed_planet:

**AstroScale** is a fun and educational planetary weight calculator based on the open-source openScale project. Ever wondered how much you would weigh on Mars, Jupiter, or even Pluto? AstroScale lets you find out instantly!

Automatically calculate your weight across our solar system (and its neighbors) based on a single Earth weight measurement. Connect to your Bluetooth scale or enter your weight manually to see your planetary stats!

> [!NOTE]
> AstroScale is a specialized fork of [openScale](https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale). While it retains the core privacy and Bluetooth connectivity features, the metrics and UI have been reimagined for planetary exploration.
